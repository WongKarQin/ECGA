the work of paper《An Improved Genetic Algorithm for Web Phishing Detection Feature Selection》
an improved Genetic Algorithm for feature selection problem on 2 public Web Phishing Detection datasets
the requirement of computing power is very low, just execute the algorithm on PC in Pycharm
the source of 2 public Web Phishing Detection datasets:
1.Dua D, Graff C. UCI machine learning repository. University of California, School of Information and Computer Science, Irvine, CA[J]. 2019.
2.Tan C L. Phishing dataset for machine learning: Feature evaluation[J]. Mendeley Data, 2018, 1: 2018.
