# ECGA
the work of paper《An Improved Genetic Algorithm for Web Phishing Detection Feature Selection》<br>
an improved Genetic Algorithm for feature selection problem on 2 public Web Phishing Detection datasets<br>
the requirement of computing power is very low, just execute the algorithm on PC in Pycharm<br>
the source of 2 public Web Phishing Detection datasets:<br>
1.Dua D, Graff C. UCI machine learning repository. University of California, School of Information and Computer Science, Irvine, CA[J]. 2019.<br>
